# RCINE
This algorithm is formulated to addresses the problem of multiclass classification with corrupted or noisy bandit feedback. In this setting, the learner maynot receive true feedback. Instead, it receives feedback that has beenflipped with some non-zero probability. We propose a novel approachto  deal  with  noisy  bandit  feedback,  based  on  the  unbiased  estimatortechnique. This algorithm can also efficiently estimate the noise rates, and thus providing an end-to-end framework. The proposed algorithm enjoys mistake bound of the order ofO(âˆšT) in the highnoise case and of the order ofO(T^2/3) in the worst case.

## We have  uploaded  the first version code. If you face any difficuilties in running the code please contant me at mudit.agarwal@research.iiit.ac.in
